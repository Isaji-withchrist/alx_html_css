# 🎧 Headphones - Responsive Web Design Project

Welcome to the **Headphones** landing page project, built as part of the `alx_html_css` repository. This responsive web page replicates a high-fidelity design from Figma, using only HTML and CSS. The design adapts seamlessly across devices and provides a clean, modern layout inspired by a music streaming service or audio product showcase.
